// You are to create 3 variables for a "square shape" class which will be "class A", shapeSides (number of sides of the shape), shape length
// and shape breadth. From your knowledge of encapsulation, create getters and setters for lenght and breadth variables and create only a
// getter for shape side(this is because we dont want anyone setting the sides of a square. the sides of the sqaure must and always will be 4).
// Create another class "B", set the values of length and breadth. Get the value of the length and breadth and calculate the area. print out
// your final calculation like this. "The area of a sqaure of length: {put the value of the length} and breadth {put the value of the breadth}
// is {put the value of the area u calculated}"
